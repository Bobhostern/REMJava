REMJava Library version 0.1
-=============================-
REMJava is a library I am deciding
to open-source. Yes, it is just
a bunch of files and objects I 
thought would be convienient.
Let's see how big we can make it.
But one rule:
	Must be fully-functional.

Inside the NetBeansProjectZIP folder
is a ZIP file you can import onto your installation
of NetBeans.
